# Manual Installation

OpenCVE can simply be installed using `pip` :

```
$ pip install opencve
```

## Configuration file

OpenCVE uses an `opencve.cfg` file to handle its configuration (database access, mail config, pagination...).

So the first step is to create this configuration file. You can do it with the `init` command :

```
$ opencve init
[*] Configuration created in /Users/ncrocfer/opencve/opencve.cfg
```

!!! tip
    A custom path can be specified in the `OPENCVE_CONFIG` environment variable. Check the [init documentation](../commands.md#init) for more details.

## Initialize the database

The database is configured with the `database_uri` variable of the `opencve.cfg` file :

```
$ vim ~/opencve/opencve.cfg
...
database_uri = postgresql://john:mysupersecret@servername:5432/opencve
...
```

Once done the `upgrade-db` command will create all the tables :

```
$ opencve upgrade-db
```

!!! note
    Because it uses the JSONB feature for performance, OpenCVE only supports PostgreSQL.

## Import the data

The tables are created, you can now populate them using the `import-data` command :

```
$ opencve import-data
```

This command download the list of CPE, the list of CWE and each CVE's year (from 2002 until now), so **it can take several minutes**. Don't worry you will only do it once.

!!! warning
    The NVD data are downloaded, extracted and then parsed **in-memory** before being inserted in the database. For that the `import-data` command needs **5GB** at least to correctly do its job. Afterwards, the worker use very small memory as only the diff is used with the NVD.

    If you launch `opencve import-data` without this memory space the command will be killed (OOM) by your operating system and your data will be incompletes.

    We wrote a [documentation](../faq.md#how-to-use-the-disk-space-for-the-import-data-command) to handle this problem using a SWAP file.

## Start the workers

The synchronization between the OpenCVE database and the CVE list is done using a periodic Celery task.

The configuration of Celery is done through the `celery_broker_url` and the `celery_result_backend` configurations :

```
$ vim ~/opencve/opencve.cfg
...
celery_broker_url = redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
celery_result_backend = redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1
...
```

!!! info
    Celery supports several transports, like Redis and RabbitMQ. You can find more information on the [official documentation](https://kombu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/connections.html#connection-urls).

The worker and the scheduler can then be started with the following commands :

```
$ opencve celery worker -l INFO
$ opencve celery beat -l INFO
```

## Create an admin

You can now create the admin :

```
$ opencve create-user john john.doe@example.com --admin
Password:
Repeat for confirmation:
[*] User john created.
```

!!! tip
    This command is required for the first admin, then you will be able to manage the users with [the admin pages](../admin.md).

## Start the webserver

You can finally launch the webserver and visit OpenCVE at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` :

```
$ opencve webserver
[2020-07-14 20:38:06 +0200] [16032] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4
[2020-07-14 20:38:06 +0200] [16032] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (16032)
[2020-07-14 20:38:06 +0200] [16032] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2020-07-14 20:38:06 +0200] [16040] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 16040
```

!!! tip
    The server name can be configured in the `opencve.cfg` file with the `server_name` variable. See the [documentation](../faq.md#how-to-change-the-server-name) for that.
