## What is OpenCVE

**OpenCVE** is a platform used to locally import the list of CVEs and perform searches on it (by vendors, products, CVSS, CWE...).

Users subscribe to vendors or products, and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE.

You can [manually install](installation/manual.md) OpenCVE, or [use docker](installation/docker.md). We also provide a running instance on [https://www.opencve.io](https://www.opencve.io) if you don't want to host it yourself.

## How it works

OpenCVE uses the [JSON feed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds#JSON_FEED) provided by the [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) to update the local list of CVEs.

After an initial import, a background task is regularly executed to synchronize the local copy with the NVD feed. If a new CVE is added, or if a change is detected, the subscribers of the related vendors and products are alerted.

!!!info
    For now the only method of notification is the mail, but we plan to add other integrations (webhooks, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, OpsGenie...).

## Requirements

OpenCVE works with **Python >=3.6**.

It uses the JSONB feature for performance, so you will need a **PostgreSQL** instance to store the data (CVE, Users, Vendors, Products, Subscriptions, ...). Other engines are not supported.

Celery is used to periodically fetch the NVD database and update the list of CVEs. For that you will need a broker : we recommend you **Redis** for the ease of installation. Futhermore it is possible that future versions of OpenCVE will use a cache feature, in that case the Redis requirement will already be filled for you.

During the import of initial data OpenCVE will download and parse huge files, like the CPE dictionnary. For that we recommend you **3.5G RAM** at least.

## Installation

We provide 2 methods to install OpenCVE :

- [manual installation](installation/manual.md)
- [docker installation](installation/docker.md)

The second method can be useful if you don't want to manage the dependencies (like PostgreSQL, Redis or Celery).

Check these documentations for the details of each step (initial import, admin creation, etc).
